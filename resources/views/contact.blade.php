  <h1>&#x1F34D; Contact PAS Library </h1>
  <p>Hey, the staff at PAS Library wanna hear from you, our fellow pineapple lover! We wanna know how excited you are by pineapples, and all the wonderful things it can do in the future.</p>
  <p>Unfortunatly we can't, since you live in the past and we are in the future. Yeah the Timetravel Commission of Pinearth is pretty strict about how "no direct contact should be made". Real bummer.</p>
  <p>You could write a letter, and then will it to your heir with instructions that for the letter to be passed from ancestor heir to decedent heir, and so on, until the Library is created and the letter can be delivered.</p>
